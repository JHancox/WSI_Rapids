# WSI_Rapids
Whole Slide Imaging with RAPIDS

Prerequisites:
See on ngc.nvidia.com/catalog/containers/nvidia:rapidsai:rapidsai for details

* WDI_Dask_Notebook.ipynb - the first notebook to run which generates features from the patient_100_node_0.tif
* WSI_cugraph.ipynb - the second notebook, which uses the wsi_dfx file generated by the previous notebook
* docker_build - folder containing a docker container build script
  * Dockerfile - file used to build a local Docker container that has all the dependencies needed

Steps to run the pipeline:

Launch a terminal in the root of the repo folder
 
Copy the following files into this directory
* M2_WEIGHTS.PT - model weights for the VAE. Provided so that training it is optional

* patient_100_node_0.tif - WSI from the Camelyon 16 dataset

* wsi_dfx - a dataframe containing tile features.

cd docker_build

docker build -t wsi_demo:v1 .
 
You can then run the container that this builds:
docker run –gpus all –rm -it –ipc=host -p 8808:8888 -v [absolute path to current folder]:notebooks wsi_demo:v1

The host folder should appear as 'notebooks' in the container, which means you can load and save things easily from the container.
create a symlink: 
ln -s /notebooks notebooks
This should make the folder appear in Jupyter

Once this is done, you should be able to simply browse to the jupyter lab using localhost:8808/lab

Load WDI_Dask_Notebook.ipynb to threshold the WSI and feature-encode it
Load WSI_cugraph.ipynb to analyse the features with RAPIDS
